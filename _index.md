heroDescription: A list of software applications, libraries and hardware that includes support for Post Quantum Cryptography

---

The PKI Consortium is managing a PQC Capabilities Matrix (PQCCM) of software applications, libraries and hardware that includes support for 
Post Quantum Cryptography, without endorsing their implementation or quality.

The list includes a wide variety of software applications, libraries, and hardware from different vendors. 
The list should be considered a living document and a starting point. Considering the rapid change in the area such things can vary from day to day and complete freshness of information can only be gathered from vendors directly. 

The PKI Consortium is actively working to promote the adoption of Post-Quantum Cryptography, and the capabilities matrix is a key part of that effort.

**What the PQCCM does**:
* collects and aggregates information on PQC capabilities across the cybersecurity landspace (vendors, software, hardware, etc..)
* lists products that provide PQC functionality to the end user, not merely for example PQC enabled TLS access to a non PQC enabled service

No other activities besides those listed above are under the purview of PKI Consortium (unless explicitly stated otherwise).

**What the PQCCM doesn't do**:
* review, vet, verify or test implementations or interoperability
* perform source code review, formal review of algorithms, etc.
* provide information, documentation or any recommended usage of Post Quantum Cryptography

## Contribute

This list is a collaborative effort. To contribute please:
* Create an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/pkic/pqccm).
* Create a pull request on [GitHub](https://github.com/pkic/pqccm).
* Participate in PKIC and the PQC working group and send an email to the list.
